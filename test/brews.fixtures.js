            details: '18th Street Brewery was founded as a home brewery by Drew Fox in 2010. After years of hands-on learning and exploration, 18th Street Brewery became official with the release of SINISTER DIPA in 2013. Shortly after the SINISTER release, we opened a 3,200 square foot brewpub in an old dry cleanerâ€™s building in Gary, IN. Quickly outgrowing that space, we purchased a 32,000 square foot warehouse in Hammond, IN. Our Hammond location now houses our production, packaging, barrel program, a taproom and a full service kitchen. Our original Gary, IN now houses a small 10-barrel open fermentation system, as well as a taproom, craft cocktail bar and kitchen.',
